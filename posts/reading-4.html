  <h1>Paul Graham essays</h1>
  <p> I just want to start off by saying that I do think bell bottom jeans look good. </p>

  Something that stuck out to me was how Graham described hackers as something very American. He believes that hackers have been around for a while and that the founding fathers 
  were hackers too. I feel like this implies that the traits of a hacker like curiosity, creativity, and like challenging/ questioning authority or norms are things in American culture. 
  On the other hand, Levy believes that his hackers were the OG since they were exploring this new digital world. Levy also emphasized openness and curiosity rather than like the background
  of a hacker. I don't know why I don't like this "the essence of Americanness" rhetoric for defining hackers. Maybe because it feels wrong to imply that this creativity and innovation is only coming from America. I mean the man who created python is dutch and I think python is a cool hack. Or maybe I am just reading too much into this. I just think tying something creative and technical closely to a country causes people to overlook at the progress and innovation happening all over the world. I don't think hacking is about making the most innovative thing, but rather something one just really enjoys.

  On a better note, I really appreciated Graham’s analogy between computer science and art. Memorizing algorithms and mastering data structures is important, but it takes a creative, almost artistic approach to solve new problems. This idea resonated with me because it highlights the hacker as a maker and innovator, not just a technically skilled worker. It does take art/form of creativity to figure out how to solve new problems. I took ceramics my sophmore year and I genuinely thought it was harder than any class I've taken before (I was in systems during this time and I was also taking dan's discrete math I think). I think in order to create anything, you have to really understand all details so you can come up with something good. Also, art and hacking can both feel very rewarding in a similar way which I never would've realized before reading these essays

  Another thing I noticed about how Graham described a hacker was someone who was very independent. I feel like previously we have only really seen hackers in group settings such as in clubs or working in labs together. They would share ideas and collaborate with each other. But there doesn't seem to be much mention of that in Graham's version. He describes a hacker as someone who is basically a rebellious genius who can be rude because they are super productive and good worker. I feel like people shouldn't idealize "hackers" who are rude or aren't able to talk their ideas out with someone who may not agree.
  Also, I can see how unstructured learning can be good for some people. I feel like personally, I would need like more guidance but maybe that is what makes me not a hacker... Anyways, this gave me montessori school vibes. The rumors are that all nd profs send their kids to one.

  It may seem that I didn't like reading Graham's essays because I have some disagreements. However, I did enjoy reading his essays because it helped me redefine what is means to be a hacker. It can be someone who creatively solves solutions and thinks outside of the box.
