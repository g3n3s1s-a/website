  <h1>growing up</h1>

  <p>
    I definitely did not grow up like how Linus did. My parents were not able to graduate from high school due to the effects of war/financial issues so they 
    never introduced me to like anything math/science related. So maybe I was a bigger of a nerd than Linus growing up because I enjoyed math and science on my own. I also never really learned how to type lol. It is embarrassing because I am a cs major and I like type with 2 fingers. Please don't judge.

    I feel like being exposed to things like cool math stuff and computers does help you further discover what you like when you get older. It can just give you that experience so you know if you don't like something or its something you want to continue. Or like even the funds to actually explore what you wanted. The first time I ever interacted with a computer was in kindergarten. It was a class computer and we used it to play games lol. Then I got my own laptop in middle school because my parents thought I was going to need it for school. I also just used it for games and learning software. My "love" for tech came from learning about different phones and laptops. I used to think cs majors were the apple salespeople. My mom also thinks that what cs majors do lol.

    My interests in school was also very narrow like Linus. It was always math. I would say I was like a good student overall. I usually did well but it was like without trying much. I really got humbled once I got to ND lol. I even wanted to be a math teacher for a while but all my math teachers told me to not to do it since the money is terrible. Well at least in california. I thought about that when I read that Linus never really cared about money. Which is interesting because I see that like he had a family and everything but never cared about like bringing in more money for that. Idk I always just assumed that when I have a family, I would want to make more and MORE money so that they can all enjoy life and not have to worry about things.

    I did not know that Linus was Finnish. I enjoyed learning about his life there, the school culture, and finnish's love for saunas. The endowments for students is crazy to me. There is no way a elementary schoolers can get free money for being "best liked". I wish that was me. All my school had were awards for perfect attendance and that was literally just a piece of paper and if you attended school everyday for your time there, you would earn a pin.
