  <h1>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</h1>
  <p>
  Before reading Hackers, I’ve heard of “hackers” in the sense that they were the “bad” people or the attackers of some sort of computer system. I have also heard of “hacks” online such as “life hacks” and “games hacks” but I think I never thought of how those two definitions could come together.
  </p>
  <p>
  To Steven Levy, “True Hacker” seems to be someone who is very interested/passionate about creating and exploring new ways to do things using computers. A “True Hacker” does things not for profit or attention but to do things because they are able to create something for the world.  As well as improving on these “hacks” from other hackers. 
  </p>
  <p>
A “True Hacker” doesn’t necessarily need to know everything about a computer. For instance, Bill Gosper who was able to create algorithms from his math background. Although he was considered a “math hacker”, he was still a hacker because he was able to create something interesting. Especially since these new algorithms cut off a few lines of code which the other hackers were very excited about. 
  </p>
  <p>
What I liked about “True Hackers” was the idea of finding something you are extremely passionate about and just working on that using the hands-on imperative. Richard Greenblatt may have been too extreme for me because he was on academic probation, however he found a job where he was able to make money doing what he wanted. With that money, he was also able to support (questionable) himself and work at the lab at night. 
  </p>
  <p>
Being passionate would be an understatement for these hackers. Something that surprised me was that all the guys who worked in the lab were working for sub minimum wage. And they were ok with that because they were able to work on something they loved. I don’t think the hackers even cared about the money. Seeing that made me think if I would ever do anything for sub minimum wage. Am I passionate about anything? Maybe the question isn’t about whether I am passionate about something but rather if I am able to afford to spend my time on something that doesn’t pay. Do I have that privilege?  
  </p>

One thing I didn’t like about the idea of being a  “True Hacker” was how Bob Saunders responded to Marge when she asked for help. I understand that it is supposed to be a joke about hackers thinking logically, however I find it contradicting when the hackers were happy when the computers would play music and make the program more human but then want to be super logical with actual humans.
  </p>
  <p>
Another thing I noticed was the lack of self-care among these hackers (haha). It seemed that being a “True Hacker” meant pushing aside basic needs in order to chase passion. I have trouble understanding how these hackers didn’t take care of themselves but were still able to be innovative. 
  </p>
  <p>
I think in a world where I can let go of my worries about the future and money, I could see myself aspiring to become a version of a “True Hacker”. I would focus on adding in some elements of cleanliness as well as connecting with others who may be less passionate than I am. I think it is important to not make a group that is super exclusive so that others can join feeling welcomed and hopefully be inspired to make a hack.
