  <h1>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</h1>

  <p>
    The "Hardware Hackers" seemed a bit more normal to me than the "True Hackers". One: they are from California,so they are automatically cooler. Two: They wanted to share this really cool technology and spread the Hacker Ethic with people who weren't already hackers. The "True Hackers" were very passionate about hacking, however didn't really seem like they wanted to help remove the barrier for people to get into hacking or make computers approachable. The "Hardware Hackers," on the other hand, made it their mission to figure out how to create a bigger community that could include everyone.

    These "Hardware Hackers" reminded me of myself because I also like the idea of making technology and things that should be accessible more accessible to everyone. I've been an McInerney mentor for a few years now at Notre Dame and I feel like it helps me be able to help lower classmen just be more aware about what opportunities they can take advantage of and to just feel like they belong on a campus at Notre Dame. They don't have to go through the same mistakes I went through as a freshman haha (almost failing calc 1 even though math has always been my favorite subject). I also always try my best to TA for a class I enjoyed because I think its a really good way to share resources and tips I used to do well but also be able to give them advice. I guess what I am trying to say is build these relationships and a sense a community with others while trying to figure out this whole college thing. The "Hardware Hackers" built this community where people can meet up to talk about issues they are facing with their newest projects and I know from experience asking for help with a personal project can feel a bit too personal... But when you are exposed to a space or a person that truly wants to help and see you grow, is where one can see their full potential (shout out tin and devante).

    The quote above may be a bit dramatic but I thought it was a good quote to describe some of the people towards the end of the section (*cought* Jobs *cough*).

    Toward the end of the section, it was sad seeing the Homebrew Computer Club drift apart from. What started as a cute (men only) meeting to talk about their new toys slowly got split apart because of "company secrets". People who had once collaborated side by side were suddenly opps (competitors), guarding their new ideas or discoveries instead of sharing knowledge freely or synergize (I can't believe that word was created by literally my people. I really thought the mebrozas were the ones who created that word). It made me think about how easily collaboration can turn into competition once money is involved. I feel like once money got involved, the whole point of the club was gone. People stopped showing up not just because they signed dotted lines about company secrets but also they had big jobs to do now. Maybe money is just always the problem. Anyways, github to me now seems like something Homebrew Computer Club would of liked because we are all able to share out code virtually but we aren't really able to have much dialogue or ask many questions.

    Maybe the whole point of meeting up every week was not just to see what are the coolest hacks, but just to feel like you are a part of something bigger.
