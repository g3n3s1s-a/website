  <h1>cathedral or the bazaar</h1>
  <p>
    I didn't know what the term open source meant until sophomore year of college, which is crazy to think about as a CS major. When I first learned what it was, I thought it was super cool that people who are interested in computer science have a community online that shares information and helps each other out. I haven’t heard of other majors having this sort of thing. I think that’s one of the things I really like about being a CS major, thatthere’s a sense of community whenever you meet someone else who codes. It made me wonder, why isn’t everything just open source? Why do we have the cathedral?

    I feel like the obvious answer is money. People need money so people creates way of making that happen. But there has to be another reason another than money right? So if I am understanding correctly, the cathedral model is like making software hidden from the public. It is very planned, managed by a small team, and "perfect". This is very different to the bazaar which is open source because the bazaar is just a very chill and open way to make software. I guess I never really thought about how "messy" the bazaar can be since there is less control but it somehow works out.

    Really thinking about my experiences, I think I mainly worked on software using (idk if using is the right word or in or with) cathedral model. Usually how it goes is that one person leads, and we each have fixed roles. The only real open source I have experience is like just looking on GitHub repos when I want to learn something or see how someone did something. I like to peek at the pull requests and see what bugs people are fixing. But when I do find a good repo, I am like wow someone really put time and effort and decided to share this to the world for free. They probably made it because they were trying to solve a problem they had or simply out of curiosity. That is how I know it is some good code.

    I have been thinking about ESR’s point that open source might win in the long run and if all this AI hype would affect it. I understand that many people testing and improving code, problems get fixed sooner, and ideas spread quicker. However, are people still going to know how to code to be able to fix these issues or are we just going to rely on an LLM to code for us and fix it and just create some shitty code because it is being trained on buggy open source code... 
  </p>

  <p>
  Overall, reading ESR helped realize that open source isn’t just about free software, it connects back to the hacker ethic and it’s a way of thinking, of trusting the community to build something bigger together. That’s a mindset I want to keep as I go further into my life.
