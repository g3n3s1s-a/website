  <h1>Hackers: Get that bread</h1>

  <p>
  Sophomore year, when CS4Good was barely alive, I joined a team that volunteered at DePaul Academy to teach teen boys how to code in Python. DePaul Academy was essentially a high school for kids in juvenile detention. We weren’t teaching them to become “hackers” or even to love coding, but to give them skills that could open doors for college opportunities, jobs, and maybe a different future. Does that make me “anti-hacker” because I was teaching someone coding as a means to make money and stability, rather than for joy or curiosity? I don’t think so.

  As I keep reading the book, I see more clearly why the hacker ethic isn’t universal. We all come from different walks of life, and computers are tools that serve different purposes depending on our situations.

  I also don’t see Ken Williams as a villain. He did what he needed to do to allow “true hackers” to share their work to distribute knowledge, and these hackers could make a living even if that wasn’t his original goal. He came into the computing industry with dollar signs in his eyes. I can’t blame him for that. In high school, I started a small jewelry business on instagram but not because I loved jewelry at first, but because I needed money. My parents weren’t just giving me money; they expected me to work as soon as I could. So I hustled haha. Over time, I grew to enjoy designing jewelry and even saw it as an art, but money was my initial motivation.

    And that’s the tension: it’s perfectly fine to do things for money, but there’s something sad about losing sight of joy, creativity, or meaning. I genuinely enjoy coding, but I can’t imagine doing it forever as a career. I worry it would make me resent it especially if I had to solve problems I didn’t care about or build solutions that I didn’t believe actually helped anyone. I can imagine myself just getting so upset that I had to build something that I thought was a waste of my time.

  This section of the book reminds me of job interviews, when they ask: “Why us?” or “Why do you want to work here?” Of course you can’t say, “because I need money.” You have to perform passion. It’s taboo to admit you’re doing something just for the paycheck, even though there’s nothing inherently wrong with that. The assumption is that if money is your only reason, you won’t work as hard or care as much. But is that really true?

  Fun fact: When I was 16, I applied to McDonalds and I got rejected (prepared me for this job market frfr). I think it was because when the manager asked me why I wanted to work at McDonalds I laughed.

  Maybe this argument that money shouldn't be your main reason should only be used in higher skill roles. But I don't know, over the summer it felt so ungenuine when I would go to some of the talks from the higher up people of the company and they would say something like "I really enjoy my job here because I love being a leader and figuring out how to increase connections across people". Like girl, we are just making sure the transactions went through. But maybe I am just being too judgemental. Do I even dream of working lol?
