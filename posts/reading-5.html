  <h1>cs backstory</h1>

  <p>
    It all started in 6th grade. My school district was trying to make things better so they chose my middle school to have the first engineering lab/classroom. My middle school offered engineering as a course for 0th period and me being a #nerd #tryhard #ambitious I obviously signed up and quickly realized I was the only girl in that class. The teacher felt bad for me so he tried giving me cool individual projects and he tried teaching me how to code (idk what language it was but it was like for some robots). I did not like it and told him I rather do more building with my hands like robotics so he stopped. It is funny how things have changed because I would NEVER want to build something physically using my hands today.

    Once I got to high school, there were no engineering class so I never heard about coding again. In my senior year, the high school started a technology class and I think they taught how to code but they introduce the class as like a video game club class so I never really explored it. I never had a console or played much video games so that was just a foreign world to me. Once I had to apply to colleges, I needed to think about my major... I originally wanted to do math but all the counselors told me that there were no jobs for them so to pick computer science since its the closest thing to math. I didn't even question it or think about it and that is just want I did. I still can't believe I didn't even like research what it was or anything and just did it.

    Then I got to Notre Dame and let me tell you. I was AFRAID. It felt like everyone knew how to code already even the non-cs majors. I definitely was doubting myself and was thinking about switching to another major but I could not find anything else I would be remotely interested in. So I just stuck with it and then in spring semester of freshman year, I began learning MATLAB. It was a fun time learning MATLAB. Then when I started learning Python I realized that there are better languages out there. I didn't realize how annoying and limited MATLAB was until I saw the power of python.

    When I got to fund comp, C really did scare. Crossword and game of life... Those were truly scary times but I don't think I felt truly confident until I took Computer Networks. Making a p2p system was a very scary time. That is where I truly learned how the power of C. I also learned some other languages when I took paradigms such as java. I thought java was really cool and like how organized it felt. I also really liked OOP. I never really understood it until I did it in java. I haven't done any cool projects in java but that is on my list so I can feel more confident in it.

    So now for the question, do I think there are better languages than others? Yes I do. C is just so good and fast but you really need to understand the problem you are solving in order to use it right. Python has so many libs for all different types of problems so it makes coding very accessible and easy to use. Basically like psuedocoding. I always try to learn javascript since I need it for my research when they want me to do web dev stuff and I HATE it. I like never understood it. Idk why it exists and why I have to deal with blobs and stuff.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also think programming languages have changed the way I think. I feel like each languages makes you think problems in different ways. So like it overall just helps me be a more critical thinker.

    I want to learn rust but I could never think of a cool project so I am hoping this coming project will help me learn it.
