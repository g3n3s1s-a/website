  <h1>open source</h1>
  <p>
  How does open source exist in a world of GREED? ESR mentions that the open source world has this "gift culture" where money is replaced 
  with reputation and respect. So basically,hackers give away their code because it earns them recognition, satisfaction, and a sense of belonging in a community that values their hacking. 
  Contributing is also a way to learn and improving their abilities. The other motivator is that hackers like to solve their own problems and so they share their solution to others who could 
  be facing similar problems. So there is still some self interest just other forms (not money). Do people only do things out of self interest? that could be a good talk for another time :)

  What I didn't think about before we the taboos in the open source community. That at first seemed a bit contradictory because I thought the point was you can like do whatever you wanted but 
  it makes sense why there are taboos. They to me seem more like common sense/ basic human decency. The taboos are there to help maintain trust and cooperation among hackers. If people freely forked and erased credit, the community would become chaotic and competitive instead of collaborative. In that sense, these norms protect the culture rather than limit it.

  Another thing I didn't think about was the economics of open source. To be fair, I don't know much about economics expect for supply and demand. 
  I agree with ESR that giving away software for free doesn’t mean there is no value in it. I feel like if we say if it cost nothing there is no value because then we would be disrespecting the hackers work and their time. But the value is what it can do and how it helps us. Also, I like how he brought up selling services instead. Idk why I instantly thought of SaaS and instantly cringed. I don't think he meant SaaS when he wrote this but he meant it more as like paying for experts and like realiable support. I feel like most companies now a days use this kind of model of using open source code and then selling a service.

  Ok so the next thing I wanted to talk about was the sustainability of this open source world. I see its benefits and how it is better than commercializing everything, but how can we expect people to
  volunteer their time to create software that big tech companies are using. The “magic cauldron” still works, but I don't know how the hackers will feel about fairness and long-term motivation.
  Would the "gift culture" still be enough for the next few decades?

  Overall, these essays show that open source is not just about free software but about it’s about shared effort, community trust, and the idea that collaboration can produce better results than competition. The culture continues to evolve, but the motivations like pride, curiosity, and community still drive people to keep the magic cauldron boiling or whatever he says.
