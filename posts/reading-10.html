  <h1>success</h1>

  <p>
    I am really enjoying the writing style of this book. I usually complain about reading because I am really slow and get bored but I am eating this 
    book up. 

    Some side notes I took as I was reading:
    It makes me happy that Linus's community was super supportive of his OS. I also don't like rootbeer. Or any type of carbonated drink. 
    When Linus said "I was twenty-six and for the first time in my life I was feeling old." i relate. I feel unc already
  </p>

  <p>
    I feel like I didn't really understand the trademark pickle but the way Linus was describing it just sounds super nonchalant. Like he didn't even have money for a lawyer and he doesn't really know the details about like what happened at the end. He just cares it's over. I guess this shows how like he doesn't really care about the buisness side or like anything other than actually coding/making the software. Which makes sense cuz he is a hacker at core.
  </p>

    He eventually moved to the US for work opportunities and it was just a good place for growing tech. This made me question if I would ever move to another country for a job. The idea of that sounds super super cool and him moving to the US probably benefited Linux greatly. I guess I just have a fear of feeling completely alone/feeling lonely. It also scares me to completely start over in a brand new place. Again fear of failure and making mistakes. Maybe I should move to another country for some exposure therapy. 
  </p>

    I am also jealous how Linus is just getting all these jobs offers left and right. Like why can't that happen to me too.
  </p>

  <p>I really like how Linus tells us how getting sleep was important. I feel like in the other books, all I hear is hustle/grinding/all nighters/ workaholics. I thought being passionate about something meant I had to always be working on it and let it consume my life. Idk him saying he always gets his sleep just makes him seem more normal and like not a super crazy smart guy who created Linux
  </p>

  <p>
    Jobs and Linus to me seem like the same person but just on like opposite ends if that makes sense. They are both passionate about what they do, they have their own arguments why they are right, and just assume the other person will agree with them. what makes it funny is when Linus said that Jobs was clueless but he liked him. They probably saw themselves in each other.

    Something that Linus pointed out was who do you blame when something goes wrong with open source software. People in companies love having someone to blame bc 1. its not their fault but 2. person can be assigned to fix it. But with open source, it could be God knows how many. I guess like each person did something small within it because in a very big project/software it could literally be anyones fault. I feel like this is why open source is hard to be used in big companies.
