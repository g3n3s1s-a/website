  <h1>what does success mean?</h1>
  <p>
    When I was reading these essays, I felt like PG had a simple definition of success. I know I say that money really does help with happiness but it truly isn't everything. If I could buy a few things from Aritzia and Reformation and also take a whole trip to Japan, it would make me happy. But what would I do next? Yes, I can travel across the world and see it all and buy everything I have ever wanted but eventually I will get bored and want something more.

    When my parents emigrated to the US, they also had a definition of success similar to PG. They wanted to make enough money to send back to their families and have kids who will eventually help them retire. They also had expectations that all of their kids will go to college and get well paying jobs. I can see that as my parents got older, their definition of success changed. They still held that expectation over me because if I didn't do well, what was the point of them leaving everything behind and coming to the US to give me a better life. Can you tell I am the oldest? My younger sisters didn't face this expectation, they saw that my youngest sister was really into nails, hair, and skin care. Basically all things beauty and they fully support here not going to college and trying to get her license instead. College no longer means that you are successful to them.

    My dad sometimes tells me I should start my own company because it is the only way I will truly live comfortably but I just don't see it that way. In movies, when you see a business owner, you usually see them having to take important business calls during family vacations or work super late hours. I really don't like the idea of that. I do want to be able to take my family on vacation but I don't want to be interrupt by work.

    Now that I am close to graduate and will be working soon, I have been thinking about what I want to do next. What does a success life mean to me? As some of you may know, I really want to be back in California. I don't really like the cold or the snow or the winters or the tornadoes. I like being by the beach, reading a book and just being able to go on a walk regardless of the weather. I think for now, success for me means to be able to live in a place that I find comfortable. I also experience home sickness a lot when I am in school so maybe I don't really want to live in California forever but just be near my family. My family and I have always been really close so when I started college it was really weird just not seeing them everyday.

    I don't think I have ever seen success equivalent to having a good job though. I think I saw it as a stepping stool for what success is but not like success itself. I think it just means to be able to have good/cool experiences with the people you love. I want to be able to take my family to dinner and get home to cats and have a family some day. I also want to be healthy and be able to have a good life balance. Idk I feel like these are all very simple things but I think I just want stability and comfort in my life given everything that is happening in the world today.
